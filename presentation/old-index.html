				<section data-background="images/slide_bg.png">
				<h2>Recommendations</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Openstack - Nova, Glance, Neutron, Cinder (swift, heat)
					<li>Build up a good [devops] practice.
					<li>Learn how to build resiliant data persistence services on IaaS.
				</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
					* build out ( or get help ) openstack.  stick with the core services.<br>
					* don't try and unify your legacy with this.  wasted time.<br>
					* get comfortable with them and maybe add swift and heat.<br>
					* build up a good internal devops practice, find those people in your org and nurture them.<br>
					* ask for help ... don't buy devops,  get help to understand and build your own practice.<br>
					* Start to build and run cloudy apps, figure out how to build and run resiliant mysql, postgres, elasticsearch, etc.

				<h2>Recommendations</h2>
				<ul>
				  <li>DevOps DevOps DevOps
					<li>You're probably already doing some CM
					<li>You're still going to need CM going forward.
					<li>CM + Docker is a small evolutionary step
				</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
					* can't stress how important devops is, if you don't devop you shouldn't even be talking about cloud and/or docker.<br>
					* hopefully some parts of your org are doing CM, CI/CD, etc.<br>
					* You're still going to need config management for stateful services, so starting with CM + Docker is a natural
					evolutionary step and a great way to bring benefits of docker to your org in a structured way.<br>
					* avoid the docker vs config management argument, its a silly argument as to build successful platforms you need both.
